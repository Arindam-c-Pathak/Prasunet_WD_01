            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            	<p> Welcome, this is my work for the task provided by Prasunet Company in Web Development.</p> 
		<p>Different ways to do the same thing can be applied here. </p>
		<p>I have used HTML to create the base of the project, including this paragraph and any other text.</p>
                <p>CSS was used to add the style that I wanted to the HTML file.</p>
                <p>JavaScript was the final addition to make the navigation bar interactive by changing colors when the cursor is hovering over the text.</p>

                <p>Hello there, my name is Arindam, I am a student in the field of Computer Science & Engineering, so this project has been very interesting to me.</p>
                <p>All the relevant details about me can be found through my LinkedIn profile which is linked in the contacts at the bottom of the page.</p>

        <section id="services">
            <h1>Services Provided</h1>
                <p>Although I am still learning, there is little doubt in my mind that there will be any problems with me using various programming languages.</p>
                <p>Services that I can provide include the use of Python, C, C++, and recently added quite slow usage of Java and SQL.</p>
                <p>My other projects have been in the field of Data Science.</p>
